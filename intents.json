Although some scholarships depend on outstanding academic records (‘merit-based scholarships’), your chances of success are often determined by the quality of your application, and whether or not you are in financial need. A number of universities in the US, including Harvard and MIT for example, offer ‘need-blind’ admissions policies, meaning that all students’ applications are considered regardless of their financial situation, with tuition fees then covered at least partly by the school. There are a number of things you can do to improve your chances of gaining a scholarship. When applying for scholarships, you should make sure to include all the documentation requested, and dedicate plenty of time to writing your application. In particular, it’s important to clearly communicate your motivations for studying and how gaining a scholarship will support your ambitions. Stay within the deadlines and, most importantly, show the scholarship providers you have the potential to do great things!"
